## âœ¨ Project Overview

This digital exhibition highlights the work of five Black women photographers based in Chicago. The goal is to amplify the visibility of their voices and artistic perspectives, contributing to a growing archive of Black visual narratives. As both a curator and contributor, I centered themes of resilience, cultural lineage, intimacy, and joy within the Black experience.
